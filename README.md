SoftUni Industrial
This my GitHub repository for WordPress for developers course at Softuni-exam.
The theme I have chosen for my project is Softuni-Industrial.
My idea is to introduce a welding company that offers various services such as: welding of ferrous and non-ferrous metals and construction of various facilities.
I am using this static HTML template to convert it to a dynamic WordPress theme with the help of a few custom plugins.
